All you have to do is explore, fly in your ship and meet all the factions in the game. |

Includes features that the all-content plugin does not have such as the ability to boost your combat rating and change your friendly/hostile status with factions of the game without having to save-edit. Intended to help content creators test their plugins. |

This will roughly double the amount of memory used by the game. |
