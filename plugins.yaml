    This plugin was made to allow content creators to have access to all outfits in a single place,
    for the purpose of designing and testing outfit loadouts for new ships.
    Of course, it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game for themselves
    by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it.

    A plugin for Endless Sky that allows the player to access everything
    in the game in one place. Includes features that the all-content plugin does not
    have such as the ability to boost your combat rating and change your friendly/hostile
    status with factions of the game without having to save-edit. Intended to help
    content creators test their plugins.
