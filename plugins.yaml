    by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it.

  description: |
    A redesign of an old plugin that used to pop up from time to time way back when.
    Most of the outfits use the same stats, the ships will get new sprites, outfits might not.
    This is in no way a revival, it's just a small nod to an old plugin.

    New aliens to the north of human space that can only be described as technocratic isolationists.
    They will not begin or turn hostile towards the player under normal circumstances,
    but you would be one unlucky pilot if you were to find yourself on bad terms with the Irm.

  description: |
    This plugin is intended to experiment with the Korath by creating new content for them
    in the form of ships, outfits, and missions. Any content I consider to fit well with
    vanilla is put alongside the existing Korath while any less fitting content is kept out of the
    vanilla experience, only accessible through Omnis.

    in the game in one place. Includes features that the all-content plugin does not
    have such as the ability to boost your combat rating and change your friendly/hostile
    status with factions of the game without having to save-edit. Intended to help
    content creators test their plugins.
